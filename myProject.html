              <h3>Regular-studios fan-made repolished website</h3>
              <p>
                A self-initiated fan project inspired by the upcoming indie game
                by Regular Studios. I created a full website redesign to
                practice front-end development skills, including responsive
                layout, scroll animations, and interactive elements using HTML,
                CSS, and JavaScript.
                <br />
                This project is not affiliated with Regular Studio and was
                created purely for educational and creative purposes.

              <p>
                A lightweight to-do list app developed as a beginner project to
                strengthen core front-end skills. Features include task
                creation, deletion, basic UI feedback and local storage to not
                lose previous to-do lists. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                without any frameworks, focusing on DOM manipulation and user
                interaction.
